Authors@R: c(
    person("Keith", "Dougherty", email = "dougherk@uga.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")),

Description: Computes vote-specific Shapley-Owen Values (vs-SOVs) that can be applied to various voting thresholds, weighted voting, and bloc voting. Vs-SOVs also can be applied to subsets of votes, such as issue categories, and they allow for the examination of counterfactuals. Provides functions to estimate vs-SOVs and SOVs from package estimated inputs and from user provided data.
